## Getting started

#### 1. [Setup Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

#### 2. Clone the repo

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mdanics/fluttergram.git
$ cd fluttergram/
```

#### 3. Setup the firebase app

1. You'll need to create a Firebase instance. Follow the instructions at https://console.firebase.google.com.
2. Once your Firebase instance is created, you'll need to enable Google authentication.

* Go to the Firebase Console for your new instance.
* Click "Authentication" in the left-hand menu
* Click the "sign-in method" tab
* Click "Google" and enable it

3. Create Cloud Functions (to make the Feed work)
* Create a new firebase project with `firebase init`
* Copy this project's `functions/lib/index.js` to your firebase project's `functions/index.js`
* Push the function `getFeed` with `firebase deploy --only functions`  In the output, you'll see the getFeed URL, copy that.
* Replace the url in the `_getFeed` function in `feed.dart` with your cloud function url from the previous step.

_**If this does not work**  and you get the error `Error: Error parsing triggers: Cannot find module './notificationHandler'` Try following [these steps](https://github.com/mdanics/fluttergram/issues/25#issuecomment-434031430). If you are still unable to get it to work please open a new issue._

_You may need to create the neccessary index by running `firebase functions:log` and then clicking the link_

_**If you are getting no errors, but an empty feed** You must post photos or follow users with posts as the getFeed function only returns your own posts & posts from people you follow._

4. Enable the Firebase Database
* Go to the Firebase Console
* Click "Database" in the left-hand menu
* Click the Cloudstore "Create Database" button
* Select "Start in test mode" and "Enable"

5. (skip if not running on Android)

* Create an app within your Firebase instance for Android, with package name com.yourcompany.news
* Run the following command to get your SHA-1 key:

```
keytool -exportcert -list -v \
-alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore
```

* In the Firebase console, in the settings of your Android app, add your SHA-1 key by clicking "Add Fingerprint".
* Follow instructions to download google-services.json
* place `google-services.json` into `/android/app/`.

6. (skip if not running on iOS)

* Create an app within your Firebase instance for iOS, with your app package name
* Follow instructions to download GoogleService-Info.plist
* Open XCode, right click the Runner folder, select the "Add Files to 'Runner'" menu, and select the GoogleService-Info.plist file to add it to /ios/Runner in XCode
* Open /ios/Runner/Info.plist in a text editor. Locate the CFBundleURLSchemes key. The second item in the array value of this key is specific to the Firebase instance. Replace it with the value for REVERSED_CLIENT_ID from GoogleService-Info.plist

Double check install instructions for both
